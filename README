~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Space Explorer! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This game is about flying a space ship and exploring the planets around you.
Note that you can start the ship, but oxygen, battery power, and fuel are all
possible obstacles you must overcome. Let the planet exploration happen, but be
sure to stock up on supplies!

Upcoming features? We'll see!
